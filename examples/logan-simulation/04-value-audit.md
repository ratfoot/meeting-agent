# Phase 3: Value Audit & Scoring

---

## QP Score Calculation

**QP = V × Va × Po × PI**

| Factor | Score | Justification |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **V** (Vision Match) | **8/10** | Strong insight selling—reframed his scattered frustrations as a unified "Data Harmonization Tax" with four specific barriers. HoX positioning as a "sovereign biobank" directly addresses his desire to escape walled gardens. Differentiation clear vs. building internal tooling (which he tried twice and failed). Deducted 2 points: didn't explicitly contrast against other vendor solutions. |
| **Va** (Value) | **9/10** | Exceptional quantification: $47K/quarter egress, 60% FTE, 8-month DUA delay, publication loss to Stanford. Both business value (cost savings, time recovery) AND personal/emotional value captured ("I'm a data janitor with a PhD"). Clear link to grant renewal urgency. |
| **Po** (Power) | **7/10** | Good access to Logan (Champion + pilot authority with discretionary funds). Clear path mapped to Dr. Patel (Economic Buyer). However: haven't met Dr. Patel directly. IT Security identified as blocker but not engaged. Marcus (technical evaluator) not yet on a call. |
| **PI** (Plan) | **8/10** | Solid next steps agreed: (1) Tech spec for Biobank, (2) API walkthrough with Marcus, (3) ROI model for Patel pitch. 90-day grant deadline creates natural timeline. Deducted 2 points: no specific dates locked, just "next week" and "two weeks." |

### **QP Score: 8 × 9 × 7 × 8 = 4,032 / 10,000**

**Assessment:** Strong discovery call. Above-average qualification. Key risk is Power access—need to engage Marcus and eventually Dr. Patel before momentum stalls.

## Six Pillars Audit

| Pillar | Covered? | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| ✅ Business Issue | Yes | "Spending more budget on data wrangling than actual science"; Grant renewal pressure in 90 days |
| ✅ Problem | Yes | Four barriers clearly articulated: Access, Aggregation, Normalization, Custodial |
| ✅ Solution | Yes | HoX warehouse, API, co-located compute implicitly positioned (though not demo'd) |
| ✅ Value | Yes | $47K/quarter, 60% FTE, 8-month delays, Stanford publication loss—all quantified |
| ⚠️ Power | Partial | Logan mapped as Champion; Patel and IT Security identified but not engaged |
| ⚠️ Plan | Partial | Action items agreed but no calendar holds; timeline loose |

**Pillar Coverage: 4/6 complete, 2/6 partial**

---

## Gap Analysis

### What Was NOT Covered or Remains Unclear:

1. **Budget Range** - No discussion of Logan's available budget or what "discretionary grant funds" actually means in dollars
2. **Competitive Landscape** - Did not ask what other solutions Logan has evaluated or is considering
3. **IT Security Requirements** - Specific PHI/HIPAA/IRB requirements not detailed; potential blocker not explored
4. **Timeline Precision** - "Next week" and "two weeks" are soft; no calendar invites confirmed
5. **Marcus's Perspective** - Bioinformatician pain points assumed based on Logan's description; need direct validation
6. **Dr. Patel's Priorities** - Don't know her departmental priorities or potential objections

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Champion-only access** | Medium | Schedule Marcus call immediately to build technical coalition |
| **IT Security blocker** | High | Request intro to IT Security contact; prepare compliance documentation |
| **Loose timeline** | Medium | Lock specific dates within 48 hours; anchor to 90-day grant deadline |
| **No budget discussion** | Low | Address in proposal; Logan has discretionary funds so pilot likely feasible |
| **Competitor evaluation** | Unknown | Ask directly in next call; may be sole-source given research context |

## Operational Guidance Check

### ✅ DID:
- [x] Diagnosed before pitching (asked 9 discovery questions)
- [x] Quantified value in customer's terms ($47K, 60%, 8 months)
- [x] Differentiated vs. DIY solution (failed twice, "recreating the wheel")
- [x] Mapped power structure (Logan → Patel → IT Security)
- [x] Documented plan (3 action items agreed)

### ⚠️ WATCH:
- [ ] Didn't explicitly compare to other vendor alternatives
- [ ] Assumed Marcus's pain based on Logan's narrative
- [ ] Timeline loose—risk of losing momentum

### ❌ AVOID:
- Did NOT rush to demo/pitch
- Did NOT assume Logan's enthusiasm equals purchasing authority
- Did NOT ignore personal motive ("data janitor with a PhD" → career frustration)

## Recommended Actions Before Artifact Generation

1. **Confirm budget range** - Reply email to Logan asking about pilot budget parameters
2. **Lock calendar dates** - Send specific Calendly links for Marcus technical call and proposal review
3. **Prepare compliance brief** - Draft one-pager on HoX PHI/HIPAA handling for IT Security conversation

**CHECKPOINT: Present this audit to user for confirmation before proceeding to Phase 4 artifacts.**
