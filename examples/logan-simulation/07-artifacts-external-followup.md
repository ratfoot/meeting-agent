**Subject:** Follow-up: Eliminating the Data Harmonization Tax

---

Hi Logan,

Thank you for the candid conversation today. It's rare to meet a PI who has quantified the problem as precisely as you have—the "Data Harmonization Tax" framing captures exactly what we hear from computational labs across the country.

## What We Heard

You're trying to build ML models for treatment response prediction in depression. The science is working. The data infrastructure is not. Specifically:

- **8 months** of postdoc time consumed by DUA paperwork for UK Biobank
- **$47,000/quarter** in cloud egress just to move your own data
- **60% of Marcus's time** on coordinate liftover and column munging instead of model training
- **4+ months** of delay on your lithium response GNN—time your Stanford competitors used to publish first

The core frustration: you're a scientist running a data janitorial service.

## What We're Proposing

A pilot focused on your UK Biobank psychiatric cohort (~15,000 subjects). The goal: prove that ingestion-to-analysis can go from **2 weeks to 4 hours**.

If we hit that benchmark, you'll have:
1. A concrete proof point for your grant renewal (due in 90 days)
2. Documentation to bring Dr. Patel into the conversation for departmental adoption
3. Marcus training models instead of reformatting CSVs

## Next Steps

As discussed, here's what we'll deliver:

| Action | Owner | Timing |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Technical spec: HoX + UK Biobank integration | Sarah | This week |
| ROI model using your $47K egress + 60% FTE numbers | David | This week |
| API walkthrough with Marcus | Sarah | Next week (please send his availability) |

Once Marcus validates the technical fit, we'll draft a formal pilot proposal for your review.

## One Ask

Could you connect us with your IT Security contact? Given that the pilot involves protected health data, we want to get compliance conversations started early so they don't become a blocker.

Looking forward to moving quickly on this. You shouldn't have to choose between doing science and managing infrastructure.

Best,
David
