# [INTERNAL] Deal Audit: Dr. Logan Martinez

**Account:** Computational Psychiatry Lab
**Stage:** Discovery Complete → Technical Validation
**QP Score:** 4,032 / 10,000 (Strong)
**Owner:** David (AE), Sarah (SA)

---

## Executive Summary

High-potential opportunity with a well-funded PI experiencing acute pain from data fragmentation. Logan has discretionary authority for a pilot and a clear 90-day timeline driven by grant renewal. Primary risk is incomplete stakeholder engagement—we have the Champion but haven't reached the Economic Buyer (Dr. Patel) or potential blocker (IT Security).

## QP Scorecard

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Vision Match | 8/10 | Strong insight selling; "Data Harmonization Tax" resonated. Need to sharpen competitor differentiation. |
| Value | 9/10 | Exceptional quantification: $188K/year egress, 60% FTE, publication loss. Both business and personal value surfaced. |
| Power | 7/10 | Champion access strong. Economic Buyer identified but not engaged. IT Security blocker not explored. |
| Plan | 8/10 | Action items agreed. Timeline loose—needs calendar locks. |
| **Total** | **4,032** | Above threshold. Proceed to technical validation. |

## Red Flags

| Flag | Severity | Action Required |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 🟡 **Single-threaded** | Medium | We only have Logan. If he leaves, goes on sabbatical, or gets distracted, deal stalls. Schedule Marcus call within 5 business days to build technical coalition. |
| 🟡 **No budget validation** | Medium | "Discretionary grant funds" is vague. Clarify pilot budget range ($10K? $50K? $100K?) in follow-up email. |
| 🔴 **IT Security unknown** | High | PHI handling is table stakes. Request intro to IT Security contact. Prepare HIPAA/compliance one-pager before engagement. |
| 🟡 **Competitor blind spot** | Medium | Did not ask what else Logan has evaluated. Could be sole-source (research context), but verify. |
| 🟢 **Timeline anchor** | Low | 90-day grant deadline is favorable forcing function. Use it to accelerate decision timeline. |

## Win Themes

Use these in all future communications:

1. **"Redirect 60% to Science"** - His bioinformatician training models instead of cleaning CSVs
2. **"Eliminate the Data Harmonization Tax"** - His own language; adopt it
3. **"First-Mover Advantage"** - Stanford already scooped him once; position HoX as competitive enabler
4. **"From 2 Weeks to 4 Hours"** - His stated success metric; make this the pilot KPI

## Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | Logan's Experience | HoX Differentiation |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| DIY Tooling | Tried twice, failed. "Rebuilding the wheel every 6 months." | Pre-built warehouse with modality-agnostic schema |
| Status Quo | 60% time on munging, $47K/quarter egress, lost to Stanford | Unified platform eliminates all four barriers |
| Other Vendors | Unknown—need to ask | TBD—probe in technical call |
